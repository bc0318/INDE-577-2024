## Course Description

This repository contains the machine learning algorithms introduced in the course INDE 577, Data Science and Machine Learning, during the Spring 2024 semester at Rice University. The course primarily focuses on supervised learning algorithms, with a brief introduction to a few unsupervised learning algorithms towards the end of the course.

## Course Instructor

Dr. Randy R. Davila: [rrd6@rice.edu](rrd6@rice.edu)

## Repository Content

This repository contains 11 sub-repositories, including 8 supervised learning algorithms and 3 unsupervised learning algorithms. Each sub-repository contains a README file and a Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter notebook will include an introduction, principles, advatanges, disadvantages, and implementation of each algorithm.

- Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the desired output or prediction is already known. This technique requires a dataset that includes input-output pairs, where the model learns to predict the output from the input data.
  - Supervised learning is fundamental for predictive modeling and classification. Applications include predicting stock prices, forecasting sales, and more. It allows for straightforward evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, etc., because the true outputs (labels) are known.
  - It helps in understanding which variables (features) are most important in making predictions, which can be critical in fields like medicine or economics where understanding causality or influence is important.
  
- Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data that does not have labeled outcomes. Thus, the model tries to identify patterns and structures from the data without any guidance on what output it should produce.
  - It is used to uncover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data. For instance, market segmentation in business analysis, or discovering groups of similar users in social networks.
  - Techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) help in reducing the number of variables under consideration, which simplifies modeling in other machine learning techniques and removes noise from data
